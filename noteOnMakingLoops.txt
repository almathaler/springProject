probably we can use rotate bc right now the problem is this:

  \(4)
\_/

once the ball gets to the 4th segment, the issue is that it read it not as
a set of finite points but as a slope only. and the slope of the line tells the 
ball to follow its direction (because it is a vector), so the line will actually go
like this:

\_/\ 

which it shouldn't be doing. how can we fix this?

IDEAS:
use atan2
