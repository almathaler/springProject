when you make the velY negative, it won't adhere
to the track and it will bounce tho the velX is correct

perhpas instead we can use momentum and impulse

mv = ft

calculate the momentum on impact, and then we also know force of the incline
so calculate the time until the object is brought to zero, then velocity
y starts going back down the incline (is positive again)

once we know the time, we can find the acceleration (what to keep adding to 
velYo) by using vf = vit + .5at^2 ? is that too hacky a way?
